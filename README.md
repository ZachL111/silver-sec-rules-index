# silver-sec-rules-index

`silver-sec-rules-index` is a PHP project in security tooling. Its focus is to implement a PHP security tooling project for rules incremental indexing, using append-only fixtures and checkpoint recovery checks.

## Use Case

This is intentionally local and self-contained so it can be inspected without credentials, services, or seeded history.

## Silver Sec Rules Index Review Notes

For a quick review, compare `policy width` with `trust boundary` before reading the middle cases.

## Highlights

- `fixtures/domain_review.csv` adds cases for trust boundary and claim drift.
- `metadata/domain-review.json` records the same cases in structured form.
- `config/review-profile.json` captures the read order and the two review questions.
- `examples/silver-sec-rules-walkthrough.md` walks through the case spread.
- The PHP code includes a review path for `policy width` and `trust boundary`.
- `docs/field-notes.md` explains the strongest and weakest cases.

## Code Layout

The repository has two validation layers: the original compact policy fixture and the domain review fixture. They are separate so one can change without hiding failures in the other.

The PHP addition stays small enough to inspect in one sitting.

## Run The Check

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

## Regression Path

That command is also the regression path. It verifies the domain cases and catches mismatches between the CSV, metadata, and code.

## Future Work

No external service is required. A deeper version would add more negative cases and a clearer boundary around invalid input.
